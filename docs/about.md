# Details on Each Session

## Session Classifications

Sessions for this event will be labeled demos, lessons, or hackathons so that you as a participant know what to expect going into an event.

**Demos** will be webinar demonstrations with minimal participant activity. There will be time for participants to ask questions, but there is no expectation to follow along with the presenter.

**Lessons** will be self-contained workshop sessions. Participants will be given lesson materials to follow along with instruction. If there are specific software recommendations for the workshop, they will be available on this page.

**Hackathon** sessions will have minimal instruction and allow participants to work through data or search tools related to the session topic.

### CFDE Portal Demonstration: Demonstration, 5/9

The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Portal Demonstration on Monday, May 9 will be a demonstration session. Participants will learn about how to use the CFDE portal and can ask questions about it.

### Working with Human Microbiome Project Data: Lesson, 5/10

This session will involve getting Human Microbiome Project (HMP) data off of the CFDE Portal and working in the cloud using Amazon Web Services. Participants will be provided with an Amazon Web Services account and do basic bioinformatics analysis with sequencing data.

### Introduction to R for RNA Sequencing Analysis: Lesson, 5/11

RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a popular method for determining the presence and quantity of RNA in biological samples. In this 3 hour workshop, we will use R to explore publicly-available RNA-Seq data from the Gene Expression Tissue Project (GTEx). Attendees will be introduced to the R syntax, variables, functions, packages, and data structures common to RNA-Seq projects. We will use RStudio to import, tidy, transform, and visualize RNA-Seq count data. Attendees will learn tips and tricks for making the processes of data wrangling and data harmonization more manageable. This workshop will not cover cloud-based workflows for processing RNA-seq reads or statistics and modeling because these topics are covered in our RNA-Seq Concepts and RNA-Seq in the Cloud workshops. Rather, this workshop will focus on general R concepts applied to RNA-Seq data. Familiarity with R is not required but would be useful.

### Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions, 5/11

This session will provide information on access to SPARC resources via the SPARC portal and associated APIs.

### Kids First and Human BioMolecular Atlas Program

This session will teach participants how to access and use federated CFDE graph data though the Human BioMolecular Atlas Program-Kids First collaboration through API access.
