# George's Insider's Guide to Restaurants Near the Bethesdan

For those of you trying to minimize your exposure to COVID, Bethesda
remains an area where masking is quite frequent, even without mandates,
and no one will look askance at you for wearing one. I have yet to dine
indoors and yet still go to restaurants, so you should find no lack of
great restaurants to dine at, most with cocktails, beer, and wine to go.

Two areas that have tables in fenced off streets that anyone can use,
regardless of the restaurant you are getting takeout from (Bethesda
Streetery: <https://www.bethesda.org/bethesda/bethesda-streetery> ) .
Most places also have outdoor dining tables available.
